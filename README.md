# gwendalito's Assistant Bot
Open source project of gwendalito's Assistant Discord Bot

## Requirements
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)/[pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) Library
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) Library

## Installation
I'm going from the fact that you already created a Bot and you know what you're doing.

First, you will need to install discord.py or pycord (because discord.py has been canceled) and colorama

```pip install discord.py```
```pip install colorama```
or
```pip install -U py-cord```
```pip install colorama```

Then, open `bot.py` and put your bot token in the token string (line 15).

And this is done! Wow that was hard...

## Complemental informations
You can do everything you want with the code. I'll just ask you to make it like it's your own. Customize it at a point where no one can say "Hey that's gwendalito's Assistant right?". Be creative and have a nice time with it. Bye!
